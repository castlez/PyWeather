# PyWeather
A python applications that present the user with weather information using a yahoo REST api

### Purpose
This serves as an opportunity to practice REST api calls. I plan to use this little example
in the future to experiment with REST apis.

### To Run
In the main directory of the project (.../PyWeather):  
`$ python3 main.py`  

Right now the app only retrieves information for Portland, OR. Future addition will be aimed at allowing the user to enter a location.
